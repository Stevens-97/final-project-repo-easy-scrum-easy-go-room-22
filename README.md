# WeShare

Greetings! We are Easy Scrum Easy Go and welcome to our final project repository! For our final challenge at the School of Code, we were assigned the task of creating a fullstack application for a real-world issue in 4 weeks. As a team, we decided to address the issue of access to free upskilling activities. Thus, WeShare was born, a platform where users can exchange knowledge on a class-for-class basis. In other word's you teach a workshop, you get a workshop free. To create this website, We as a team utilised the agile methodology, the rationale behind that is that agile is a people-focused, results-driven approach to software development. It’s flexible, fast and aims for continuous improvements in quality. We chose these because we felt that this was the best way to develop our app quickly in the short amount of time allocated to us.
